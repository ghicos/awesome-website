I have good control on how things appear on a webpage, however:

- I am not sure about best practices of coding
    Am I writing too many lines? 
    Using too many classes to tag elements? 
    Using CSS only to target classes? 
    --> Is there a more elegant and functional way of doing things?

- I am not considering how elements move around when the page gets bigger, smaller. But it's fine for now
